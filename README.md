## Summary
When I first started playing Dreadnought I signed up for the closed beta on their website. I had just saw a video of it on Facebook and thought it was different and cool. Week later got a redeemtion code and downloaded it to my PS4. At that time the game still had some glitchs especially in the tech trees and hanger or the menu. If you R1 or L1 to back and forth too fast the game would freeze up. I understood that it wasnt finished so I was patient at the time. Either way, thats fixed up now, and I like Dreadnought now because it's differrent then any warfare or flight sim game making it uniquly fun, but there are a few things the developers should take a look at.


Couple things the deves should look into is the network. Matchmaking in this game takes a long time and that is going to lose the attention of hardcore gamers who want to get in blow-up some Dreadnoughts and get out. Another is the sound effects and music. During a game the music and sound effects just cut out as if my speaker just died. I know my speaker didnt die because as soon as I hit the PS button the Playstation Menu music comes on. Without the sound effects it breaks the immersion of being the captain of a ship because you cant hear the crew telling you whats incoming or what weapons are ready to fire. Another function a tester might want to look at is the balance of the game, more specifically the ships. Some ships can become over powered if you join the recruit diffficulty in versus. I feel this would scare or discourage any new players to the game. 

Of course this game is still in Beta testing, but either way I like the concept of flying your own ship and engaging in epic space battles.
